## ðŸ“šProcess
The development process is as follows:

Initially, I developed the four authentication screens for the WhatsApp clone, including the phone number login and OTP verification, and implemented Firebase Authentication for secure user login and sign-up functionality.

Flutter Riverpod was used for state management, ensuring efficient handling of the application's state during user interactions.

Afterward, I built the remaining key screens of WhatsApp, including the chat list, chat screen, status updates screen, and call screen.

Finally, I integrated the necessary features for each screen using Firebase for real-time data synchronization, while continuing to manage the application's state seamlessly with Riverpod.
